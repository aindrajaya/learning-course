***
JSX ia a syntax that has looks like very similar with HTML, but the JSX is compiled to JavaScript. The Babel will compiled these JSX syntax to a pure JavaScript in the background. So it can help you to figure it out just a HTML tag element, that seem familiar to us to structuring a website.
The another important things, JSX element becomes a function in JavaScript, it has an arguments attributes called "props" and it's contents called "children"

### Here is our JSX code looks like in JavaScript
<pre>
function JSX(){
  <h1>Helloooo from JSX!!!</h1>
}
</pre>
